# 🚀 Quick Start - Login Fix

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Your `.env.local` file was missing!** It has now been created with all required environment variables.

---

## 🎯 Quick Test (2 Minutes)

### 1. Validate Configuration

```bash
node check-env.cjs
```

**Expected:** ✅ All required environment variables are configured!

### 2. Start Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Locally (Browser)

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Open Console (F12)
3. Look for: `ClientProviders - App ID: app_staging_...` ✅
4. Click "Login with Wallet"
5. Should see: `Login blocked - MiniKit not installed` (expected in browser)

**✅ If you see these logs, your environment is working!**

## 📱 Test in World App (Real Test)

### Prerequisites

1. **Start ngrok:**

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

2. **Check if URL matches:**
   - Current `.env.local`: `https://prissy-indescribable-lewis.ngrok-free.dev`
   - If different, update `AUTH_URL` in `.env.local` and restart dev server

### Testing Steps

1. Open World App on your phone
2. Enter ngrok URL: `https://prissy-indescribable-lewis.ngrok-free.dev`
3. App loads → Click "Login with Wallet"
4. Approve authentication in World App
5. **Should redirect to `/home`** ✅

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success:

```
ClientProviders - App ID: app_staging_fb26847cc38d7ca8186f5aa65fe268f3
AuthButton rendered - isInstalled: true
Login button clicked - isInstalled: true
Starting wallet authentication...
Wallet authentication completed successfully
→ Redirects to /home
```

### ❌ Problem:

```
ClientProviders - App ID: undefined
→ Restart dev server

Login blocked - MiniKit not installed
→ Test in World App, not browser

Invalid signed nonce
→ Already fixed with new secrets
```
